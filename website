1. Install and Configure Red Hat-based Web Server:

Install Red Hat Linux:
Install the Red Hat-based Linux distribution on your server. During installation, select the appropriate options, such as web server packages, to ensure necessary components are installed.

2. User Accounts and Permissions:

Create User Accounts:
Use the useradd command to create user accounts. For example:
sudo useradd username

Set Passwords:
Set passwords for the created users using the passwd command:
sudo passwd username

Manage Permissions:
Use the chmod and chown commands to manage file and directory permissions. For example, to change permissions of a directory:
sudo chmod 755 /path/to/directory

3. Install and Secure Apache Web Server:

Install Apache:
Use the package manager (dnf on recent Red Hat-based systems) to install Apache:
sudo dnf install httpd

Start and Enable Apache:
Start the Apache service and enable it to start on boot:
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd

Secure Apache:
Secure Apache by disabling directory listing and enabling the firewall:
sudo echo "Options -Indexes" >> /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

4. Deploy Basic Website:

Create Website Directory:
Create a directory to store your website files:
sudo mkdir /var/www/html/mywebsite

Create Sample HTML File:
Create a sample index.html file inside the website directory:
sudo nano /var/www/html/mywebsite/index.html
Add some HTML content to the file.

Set Permissions:
Ensure the web server has permissions to read the files:
sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/mywebsite

5. Monitor Server Performance:

Use Monitoring Tools:
Utilize tools like top, htop, or netdata to monitor server performance, including CPU, memory, and network usage.

Set Up Log Monitoring:
Configure log monitoring tools like logwatch or fail2ban to monitor Apache logs for security and performance issues.

Implement Server Monitoring Solutions:
Consider using server monitoring solutions like Nagios, Zabbix, or Prometheus to get comprehensive insights into your server's performance and health.
